Test-Clutch

Test::Clutch modifies Test::Builder and provides the ability to suspend
test output via a "clutch", which can be engaged or disengaged.  This
might sound like a crazy thing to do, but there are some nifty uses.

For example, you could use Test::Clutch to metaprogram non-test versions
of test methods, if what those test methods do is something generally
useful.  A case of this might be a Test::WWW::Mechanize used to test a
web site, but whose test methods might be employed in some other utility
scripts.
